Hello, I have a LinkedIn newsletter where I publish my forex and crypto work (https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/a-forex-trading-odyssey-7043818059437871104/). Think like a strategic marketer and do the following;

Analyze the newsletter and the content and prepare a sentiment analysis on its relevance and value.
Develop actionable input that would be used to improve the presentation, language and content of the newsletter.
Find other comparable newsletters for benchmarking and rank them including the one presented above. For context, While I am proficient in forex& crypto analysis and trading, I have very little experience with marketing, therefore make it easy to use and understand.
