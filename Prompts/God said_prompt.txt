Objective:
To create a deep, structured, and thematic biblical word study calendar, focusing on direct statements from God in the Bible, for the purpose of spiritual growth and a closer walk with Jesus Christ.

Instructions:

Extract Direct Words of God:

Scan the Bible (preferably NIV or KJV).
Extract passages where God is directly quoted or it is explicitly stated that God said/spoke.
Organize Thematically:

Group the extracts by themes (e.g., Creation, Covenant, Commandments, Promises, Warnings, Comfort, Guidance, Correction, Provision, Deliverance, Love, Restoration, etc.).
For each extract, provide:
Book, chapter, and verse
The direct statement from God
The issue or context at hand
Calendar Packaging:

Design a weekly calendar (52 weeks).
Assign one extract per week, ensuring that if a theme repeats, the passages are randomized so similar themes do not follow consecutively.
For each week, provide:
Theme/Focus
Scripture Reference
Extract (God’s Words)
Meditation focus
Prayer points
Calendar Template:

Present the information in a table format suitable for Excel, Google Sheets, or Word, with columns for:
Week
Theme/Focus
Scripture Reference
Extract (God’s Words)
Meditation
Prayer Points
Additional Requests:

If possible, provide a blank template for the user to fill in or customize.
Summarize the entire prompt for easy reuse and testing on other platforms.
Sample Table Format:
