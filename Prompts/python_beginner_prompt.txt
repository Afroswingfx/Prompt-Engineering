Seek the ultimate beginner-to-advanced, in-depth, hands-on Python programming course/platform for a career change into Python/data science/AI.

The prior beginner course was insufficient (for quizzes, real-world work).
Must be comprehensive, reputable, and have the following:
Preparation for advanced Python + real-world data science/AI
Robust tracking, regular practical exercises, hands-on projects
Certificate respected in the industry (for CV/LinkedIn)
Suitable as a foundation for a new tech career Instructions:
Deeply reason about what makes “the best” course for this context
Compare and evaluate (e.g., Coursera, edX, Udemy, DataCamp, Codecademy…)
Document at least three options with pros, cons, and suitability
Only then recommend a single most appropriate course/platform, with:
Course name, provider, direct link, features
Reason for selection
Any suggested resources or supplementary actions Required Output Format:
Section 1: Reasoning (comparative, thorough, always first)
Section 2: Recommendation (final choice, justification, and details)

Compare and contrast:

Coursera’s “Python for Everybody Specialization”
Udemy’s “100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp” Specifically:
Highlight key advantages and disadvantages of each
Use your bias to recommend one over the other, with clear reasoning
