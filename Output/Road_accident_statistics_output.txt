Step 5: General Hypothesis Inference

Observation Summary:

    Japan and Germany (technology producers) have very high car ownership rates (>60%) and very low fatality-to-accident ratios (<0.01%).
    Kenya (user country) has low car ownership (<7%) but very high fatality ratios (~0.03%), indicating less safe road environments and potentially poorer infrastructure and enforcement.
    Average driver/owner age is higher in Japan and Germany, correlating with more experienced drivers and safer behavior.
    Accident rates per owner are lower in Japan and Germany than in Kenya when adjusted for exposure.

Hypothesis Support:
Your hypothesis is supported:
Countries that produce automotive technology (Japan, Germany) demonstrate:

    Better integration of safety systems,
    More regulated and maintained infrastructure,
    Older, more experienced driver
